# Restaurant Management System - Dionysis Dining

This project is a basic set up for you to start building the JavaFX app for the INFS2605 group assignment.

Project Description
The application that we have created can virtually be used in any hospitatility setting where food is being served to a customer. However, as you will see when you utilise the application it is specifically designed and built to be used in a cinema resturant setting when customers are able to watch movies and get a premium resutrant exerperience at the same time to ensure they never miss a moment of the screening. Customers are able to both order and get ther order right away or can have it scheduled to be delivered to their seat throughout a movie. When a customer sends their order the chef will get receipt of it and can prepare the order to meet the customer needs and have it delivered right to their chair allowing them to sink in and enjoy the moment. As previously mentioned although this is a niche application tailored to a cinema organisation with a inhouse resturant offering, this will provide a unique experience to the customer where they will not have to leave their seat to get food and instead what they ordered will get cooked and delivered to where they are like a traditional resturant, making this application versitile in what it offers. This app will provide a competitive advantage to the cinema chain that picks it up and will offer a whole new level of customer experience. The customer experience improvement can allow multi-course meals to be delivered through the specificed time.
